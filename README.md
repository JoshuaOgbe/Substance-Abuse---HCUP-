# Substance Abuse Treatment Quality and Disparities Project 

Big Picture 

Quality Variables: LOS, Readmissions 

Broad Questions: 

Conditional on individual characteristics, what is the ideal LOS in treatment? 

Note: One factor to consider will be readmissions, in that longer LOSs that reduce readmissions are typically a good thing, to a point. 

Are there LOS disparities, where some subgroups are subject to LOSs lower than predicted/ideal? 

Data Sources: 

TEDS-D: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/teds-d-2019-ds0001-teds-d-2019-ds0001 

HCUP 

And maybe the survey: NDSUH 

Research Design:  

Prediction of Substance Abuse Treatment LOS and Readmissions 

Examination of LOS and Readmissions Disparities (i.e., which subgroups underperform for LOS and readmissions, particularly where LOS is too short and readmissions are higher) 

Note: One idea for a DV might be an observed/expected ratio… i.e., ratio between actual and predicted value. Then, we can look at predictors of the O/E ratio, especially when less than one. 

Constraints: 

Possibly focus on opioid only 

Perhaps limit to specific states (e.g., WI), especially due to HCUP data we have 

DVs: 

TEDS-D – LOS 

TEDS-D – NOPRIOR (Has not had prior treatment?) 

HCUP – LOS 

HCUP – VisitLink (for readmission?)
